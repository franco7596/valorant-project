## Valorant project

This personal project showcases my skills as a front-end developer and focuses on one of my favorite video games, Valorant. Using React.js, React Router, Redux, Redux-Saga, Axios, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, this project connects with the [Valorant API](https://dash.valorant-api.com/) to retrieve important information on the game's heroes and maps.

Users can create their ideal team for a specific map and access statistics on the team's performance. The web page provides insight into whether the team is ideal for that specific map and highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the team. This feature provides users with valuable information that can improve their gaming strategy and increase their chances of success in the game.

Whether you are a hardcore gamer or a casual player, this dynamic and interactive web page offers a visually appealing way to explore all the essential aspects of Valorant. As a passionate fan of Valorant, I made the decision to create this application as a way to showcase my love for one of my favorite video games. This project demonstrates my abilities as a front-end developer and my passion for the gaming world.
